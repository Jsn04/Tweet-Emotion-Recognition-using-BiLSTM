📘 Project: Tweet Emotion Recognition using BiLSTM
🔍 Objective
The goal of this project is to classify tweets into emotional categories using a deep learning model. By analyzing the emotional tone behind each tweet, the system can identify whether the tweet expresses joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, or surprise.

## 📌 Overview
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras
- Text data preprocessing with tokenization and padding
- Model: BiLSTM-based neural network
- Output: Multi-class emotion classification

## 📊 Evaluation
- **Test Accuracy:** ~87%
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~88%
- Includes a confusion matrix to analyze misclassifications
- Best performance observed in detecting **joy** and **sadness**
- Minor confusion between similar classes like **love** and **joy**

## 🔍 Highlights
- Trained on a cleaned dataset of tweets
- Early stopping used to avoid overfitting
- Simple and effective architecture for NLP classification tasks

## 📁 File
- `Tweet_Emotion_Recognition_Learner.ipynb` – full training and evaluation notebook

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Use pre-trained embeddings (like GloVe)
- Try transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa)
- Fine-tune hyperparameters and balance dataset
